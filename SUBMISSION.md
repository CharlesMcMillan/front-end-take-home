# Submission

There is only one requirement for this file, just put in whatever steps we will have to take to install and run your application, if they have changed from the default dev server we provided.

Feel free to add whatever else you feel is relevant to your submission here too (assumptions made, extra features, etc). That is not mandatory however.

### Installation Instructions

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run start`
